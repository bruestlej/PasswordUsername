🔐 Project Description

Secure Password Validator is a Python program that validates a user's password based on multiple strict security criteria. After asking the user for their name and desired password, it runs a series of checks to ensure the password is strong, secure, and personalized, including:

✅ Validation Rules:
- Password must be 8–12 characters long
- Must not contain "pass" (case-insensitive)
- Must include at least one lowercase letter
- Must include at least one uppercase letter
- Must not contain the user's initials
- Must include at least one number and one special character from !@#$%^
- Must not repeat any character more than once
It also outputs detailed feedback for each failed rule, helping users understand how to improve their password.
